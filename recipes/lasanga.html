    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Lasagna is a traditional Italian dish composed of layers of wide flat
      pasta sheets, rich and savory meat sauce, creamy béchamel or ricotta
      cheese, and melted mozzarella. The layers are stacked and baked until the
      pasta is tender, and the cheese on top is golden and bubbly. This hearty
      and flavorful dish is a popular comfort food, known for its satisfying
      combination of textures and tastes.
