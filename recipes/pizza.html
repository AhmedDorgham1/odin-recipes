        <strong>Prepare the Dough:</strong>
        <ol>
          <li>
            In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it
            sit for about 5-10 minutes until foamy.
          </li>
          <li>
            In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in

          </li>
          <li>
            Pour the yeast mixture and olive oil into the well. Stir until a
            dough forms.

          <li>
            Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth,
            and let it rise in a warm place for 1-1.5 hours or until doubled in
            size.

        </ol>
      </li>

        <strong>Roll Out the Dough:</strong>

          <li>Roll out each portion into a thin round on a floured surface.</li>

          <li>Place the rolled-out dough on a pizza stone or baking sheet.</li>
          <li>
            Spread a thin layer of tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a small
            border around the edges.
          </li>
        </ol>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong> Finish and Serve:</strong>

          <li>
